A Reolink Camera client written in Python. This repository's purpose **(with Reolink's full support)** is to deliver a complete API for the Reolink Cameras,
although they have a basic API document - it does not satisfy the need for extensive camera communication.

Check out our documentation for more information on how to use the software at [https://reolink.oleaintueri.com](https://reolink.oleaintueri.com)


Other Supported Languages:
 - Go: [reolinkapigo](https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolinkapigo)

### Get started

Implement a "Camera" object by passing it an IP address, Username and Password. By instantiating the object, it will try retrieve a login token from the Reolink Camera. This token is necessary to interact with the Camera using other commands.

See the `examples` directory.

### Using the library as a Python Module

Install the package via PyPi

    pip install reolinkapi

Install from GitHub

    pip install git+https://github.com/ReolinkCameraAPI/reolinkapipy.git

If you want to include the video streaming functionality you need to include the streaming "extra" dependencies

    pip install 'reolinkapi[streaming]'

### Styling and Standards

This project intends to stick with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

### How can I become a contributor?

#### Step 1

Get the Restful API calls by looking through the HTTP Requests made in the camera's web UI. I use Google Chrome developer mode (ctr + shift + i) -> Network.

#### Step 2

- Fork the repository
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Make your changes

#### Step 3

Make a pull request.
